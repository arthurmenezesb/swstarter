**Disclaimer: On 28 November, a rebase was performed to update the git author (I was using my work git account and it is not allowed). This action updated the commit history. A branch named "before-fix-git-author" has been created to allow reviewers to follow the original timeline. This branch will be removed after the job interview process.**
